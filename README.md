# online-banking-system

Knowing the importance of an online banking system, I decided for the project 
at PAI to create such a system based on a web application, where users can register 
very quickly and make transfers between other users. 
On the frontend I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and on the backend I used 
PHP and MySQL. The website consists of three web pages : login/register, user 
account, payments.
